            <p>A little about our history, beliefs, leadership, and values...</p>

        <article>
            <h3>The Origin.</h3>
            <p>For centuries, Architects, Engineers, and Designers have envisioned, drawn, and erected spaces for us to learn, work, live, heal, and play. Based on the newest technologies available to the creators, a lot has been built.</p>
            <BR>
            <p>But in recent decades, our industry has both stagnant technology development and consistent operational pains. In the middle of 2024, our team was at a breaking point. We didn’t want to squeeze creativity into our project schedules, undervalue billable hours, or butter-up contractors to eat change orders. We wanted technology to help us solve our biggest challenges, so we could stop being weighed down by nuanced work and start to evolve even better as an industry.</p>
            <BR>
            <p>Our team decided it was time to lead the evolution. To prioritize our own industry’s development and make great technology solutions that tangibly help our bottom line.</p>
            <BR>
            <p>Welcome to Thizo! We're glad you are here and hope you are open to integrating these operational technologies into your practice.</p>

            <h3>The People Who Build the World</h3>
            <p>Few industries understand the art and science of great spaces. Real Estate experts may understand iterations of development financing. Contractors may know how to build projects with their bare hands. All of which is admirable. Thizo believes our distinct industry within PropTech, deserves great technology too. We believe we can empower our sub industry to optimize their own businesses, grow, specialize, and advance built world design.</p>

            <h3>The Intersection of Design and Technology</h3>
            <p>Today, Thizo is using the newest technologies to continue amplifying the industry. Unlike history, today’s technology is not flying buttresses supporting a keystone or completing drawing sets via the newest drawing boards. Today, technology is built to turbocharge your firm’s operations, empowering your team to focus on the creative, the safety, the communication, and the details of each project. Let Thizo handle the nuanced work and give yourself the gift of empowerment through technology.</p>
