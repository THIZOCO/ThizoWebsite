        <p>This document sets forth the Payment Terms (the "Terms") between Thizo LLC, referred to as "Company," and the customer, referred to as "Client." These Terms govern all pricing transactions between the Company and the Client.</p>
        <h2>Credit-Based Payment</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Thizo. 
        <Br> 1.1. Purchase of Credits
            - Clients must purchase credits in advance to access services. Credits are available in predefined amounts of $5,000.00, $10,000.00, $20,000.00, or a custom amount specified by the Client.- Credits are non-refundable, non-transferable, and can only be used for services provided by the Company.
        <BR> 1.2. Credit Usage and Pricing
            - Service costs will be deducted from the Client’s credit balance as follows:  - Projects under 50,000 sq. ft.: $1,000.00 + $0.25 per sq. ft.  - Projects between 50,000 sq. ft. and 100,000 sq. ft.: $1,000.00 + $0.22 per sq. ft.  - Projects over 100,000 sq. ft.: $1,000.00 + $0.20 per sq. ft.
        <BR> 1.3. Auto Refill of Credits
            - Once the credit balance is depleted, the same payment source will be charged automatically to replenish the balance using the previously selected credit package, unless the Client provides written notice to modify or terminate auto-refill.- If the payment method fails, the Client will be notified and services will be suspended until the credit balance is replenished.
        <BR>1.4. Credit Expiration
            - Purchased credits do not expire as long as the Client account remains active and in good standing. Inactive accounts (12 months with no activity) may forfeit unused credits. .</p>

        <p>  2.1. The Company accepts payments via credit card, debit card, or other approved payment methods.

        <BR> 2.3. A valid payment method must be on file at all times for auto-refill purposes.</p>

        <h2>Invoice and Receipts</h2>
        <p> 3.1. An invoice or receipt will be issued upon the purchase of credits. The invoice will include a breakdown of the purchase amount and applicable taxes.

        <p>4.1. Credits are non-refundable and may not be exchanged for cash.
        <BR> 4.2. In cases of billing disputes or errors, the Client must notify the Company within 15 days of the transaction. Adjustments, if applicable, will be applied as credit to the Client's account.</p>

        <p> 5.1. Services will only be rendered if there is an available credit balance.

        <h2>Taxes</h2>
        <p>6.1. All credit purchases are subject to applicable taxes based on the Client’s location. Taxes will be added to the total credit purchase amount unless the Client provides valid tax-exempt documentation.
        <BR>6.2. The Client is responsible for reporting and remitting any additional taxes required by local laws.</p>

        <h2>Late Fees and Penalties</h2>
        <p>7.1. If auto-refill fails and the account balance remains negative for more than 7 days, any penalization fees incurred will be passed on to client and a disruption charge of $50.00 may be applied.
        <BR>7.2. Repeated failures to maintain a valid payment method may result in account termination.</p>

        <h2>Billing Disputes</h2>
        <p>8.1. The Client must report any billing discrepancies within 30 days of the charge. Failure to report within this timeframe will constitute acceptance of the charge.
        <BR>8.2. Disputes will be reviewed, and if the Company finds the charge to be incorrect, adjustments will be made promptly.</p>

        <p> 9.1. The Client may terminate their account at any time by providing written notice to the Company.
