        </header>
        <article>
            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <p>Made up of three licensed commercial Interior Designers, two Architects, and one Engineer, we’re a boutique team with diverse experience. And we’ve come together because we believe our industry needs to develop. After decades in the industry, across cities world-wide, our team has found a few commonalities. We love this industry. We all need and want more time to complete creative work, find complex solutions, and communicate better with our project teams . We see other industries integrating technologies, making their repetitive work more efficient. And we believe integrating similar technologies can solve our industry’s similar pain points, as seamlessly as possible; empowering our peers, colleagues, and us.</p>

            <h3>A Few Words From Our CEO</h3>
            <p>Technology is developing very very rapidly. We are at a pinch point. Shying away from advancement, or punting its integration puts our industry further and further behind. And adjacent industries - developers, REITS, “early adapting” owners are investing in these technology solutions, priming to gobble up the design, architecture, and engineering firms we love so much. To think of these alternative practitioners, with no formal design education, inventing the majority of our spaces and buildings, is not the direction we want to lead our communities. Designers, Architects, and Engineers have bravely taken on many technologies in the past; whether that’s materials, engineering aptitudes, or advancing with computer BIM modeling, we have, we can, and we will adapt further. While we face this junction together, we hope the firm integrators will lean into these new technologies. To lead the industry in empowering themselves, growing the industry into its <BR>new normal.</p>
